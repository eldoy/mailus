# TODO

- `mailus load <file>` command to create `contacts.json` from other file

- email.json isn't being used
  - no subject
  - do we need `from` here? Can be taken from config.  

- [ ] Config directory for separate configs
  - one for firmalisten
  - one for eldoy

- [ ] Log files:
  - [ ] error file
  - [ ] sent file
  - [ ] Use sent file to not re-send

- [ ] check command 'mailus check hello'
  - should check all email addresses and print status for invalid ones
